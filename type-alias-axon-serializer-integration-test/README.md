# Integration tests and example for using "type-alias-axon-serializer"
This example project, which also contains the integration tests, shows,
how to use aliases for serialization with axon as CQRS- and Eventsourcing-framework.

It uses Java EE 8 on an embedded server with in memory databases,
so there is no need to setup anything. Just start the maven build (install).

The integration tests are inside the test-package "...integration",
if you want to have a look at the unit tests.
